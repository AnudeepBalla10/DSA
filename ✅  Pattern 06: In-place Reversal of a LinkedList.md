# Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a <b>LinkedList</b>. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this </i>in-place</i>, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

<b></i>in-place</i> Reversal of a LinkedList pattern</b> describes an efficient way to solve the above problem.

## Reverse a LinkedList (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
> Given the head of a Singly <b>LinkedList</b>, reverse the <b>LinkedList</b>. Write a function to return the new head of the reversed <b>LinkedList</b>.

To reverse a <b>LinkedList</b>, we need to reverse one node at a time. We will start with a variable `current` which will initially point to the head of the <b>LinkedList</b> and a variable `previous` which will point to the previous node that we have processed; initially `previous` will point to `null`.

In a stepwise manner, we will reverse the `current` node by pointing it to the `previous` before moving on to the next node. Also, we will update the `previous` to always point to the previous node that we have processed. 

````java
class ListNode {
    int value =0;
    ListNode next;
    
    ListNode(int value){
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class ReverseLinkedList {
    
    public static ListNode reverse(ListNode head){
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode previous = null;
        ListNode next = null;
        
        while (current != null) {
            next = current.next; //temp store the next node
            
            current.next = previous; // reverse the current pointer
            
            previous = current; // before we move to the next node
            //point previous to the current node
            
            current = next; //move to the next node
        }
        
        return previous;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ListNode head = new ListNode(2);
        head.next = new ListNode(4);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(6);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(8);
        head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(10);
        
        ListNode result = ReverseLinkedList.reverse(head);
        
        while(result != null) {
            System.out.print(result.value + " ");
            result = result.next;
        }
    }
}

- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N’` is the total number of nodes in the <b>LinkedList</b>.
- We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.

## Reverse a Sub-list (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/
> Given the head of a <b>LinkedList</b> and two positions `p` and `q`, reverse the <b>LinkedList</b> from position `p` to `q`.

The problem follows the <b></i>in-place</i> Reversal</b> of a <b>LinkedList</b> pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in <b>Reverse a LinkedList</b>. Here are the steps we need to follow:
1. Skip the first `p-1` nodes, to reach the node at position `p`.
2. Remember the node at position `p-1` to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
3. Next, reverse the nodes from `p` to `q` using the same approach discussed in <b>Reverse a LinkedList</b>.
4. Connect the `p-1` and `q+1` nodes to the reversed sub-list.

    int value = 0;

    public static ListNode reverseSubList(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        if (left == right) {
            return head;
        }

        // After skipping 'left-1' nodes, current will point to 'left'th node.
        ListNode current = head, previous = null;
        int i = 0;
        while (current != null && i < left - 1) {
            previous = current;
            current = current.next;
            i++;
        }
        ListNode lastNodeofFirstPart = previous; // points to the node at index left-1;

        ListNode lastNodeofSubList = current;

            // point previous to the current node
            current = next; // move to the next node
        }

        // connect the first part
        if (lastNodeofFirstPart != null) {
            lastNodeofFirstPart.next = previous;
        } else {
            head = previous;

        ListNode result = ReverseLinkedList.reverseSubList(head, 2, 4);

        while (result != null) {
            System.out.print(result.value + " ");
            result = result.next;

> 🌟 Reverse the first `k` elements of a given <b>LinkedList</b>.

This problem can be easily converted to our parent problem; to reverse the first `k` nodes of the list, we need to pass `p=1` and `q=k`.

> 🌟 Given a <b>LinkedList</b> with `n` nodes, reverse it based on its size in the following way:
> 1. If `n` is even, reverse the list in a group of `n/2` nodes.
> 2. If `n` is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first `n/2` nodes and reverse the last `n/2` nodes.

When `n` is even we can perform the following steps:
1. Reverse first `n/2` nodes: `head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)`
2. Reverse last `n/2` nodes: `head = reverse(head, n/2 + 1, n)`

When `n` is odd, our algorithm will look like:
1. `head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)`
2. `head = reverse(head, n/2 + 2, n)`
Please note the function call in the second step. We’re skipping two elements as we will be skipping the middle element.

## Reverse every K-element Sub-list (medium)

The problem follows the <b></i>in-place</i> Reversal of a LinkedList</b> pattern and is quite similar to <b>Reverse a Sub-list</b>. The only difference is that we have to reverse all the sub-lists. We can use the same approach, starting with the first sub-list (i.e. `p=1, q=k`) and keep reversing all the sublists of size ‘k’.

The problem follows the <b></i>in-place</i> Reversal of a LinkedList</b> pattern and is quite similar to <b>Reverse every K-element Sub-list</b>. The only difference is that we have to skip `K` alternating elements. We can follow a similar approach, and in each iteration after reversing `K` elements, we will skip the next `K` elements.

## 🌟 Rotate a LinkedList (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

> Given the head of a Singly <b>LinkedList</b> and a number `K`, rotate the <b>LinkedList</b> to the right by `K` nodes.

Another way of defining the rotation is to take the sub-list of `K` ending nodes of the <b>LinkedList</b> and connect them to the beginning. Other than that we have to do three more things:

1. Connect the last node of the <b>LinkedList</b> to the head, because the list will have a different tail after the rotation.
2. The new head of the <b>LinkedList</b> will be the node at the beginning of the sublist.
3. The node right before the start of sub-list will be the new tail of the rotated <b>LinkedList</b>.
